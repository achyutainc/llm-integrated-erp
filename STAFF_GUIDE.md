# Staff Guide: Using the AI Assistant

Welcome to the Local ERP AI system! This guide helps you use the AI tools to manage the store efficiently.

## 🤖 What can the AI do?

The AI (located in your Dashboard) is connected to our inventory and order system. It acts as a helpful assistant.

### 1. Inventory & Expiry Management
*   **Check Stock:** "Do we have milk?" or "How many apples are left?"
*   **Expiry Alerts:** "Check for expiring products."
    *   *Tip:* The AI will highlight items expiring within 7 days.
*   **Locate Items:** "Where is the Basmati Rice?" (If location data is added).

### 2. Marketing Assistant
*   **Draft Posts:** "Draft a Facebook post about our fresh Ontario Apples."
*   **Instagram Captions:** "Write an Instagram caption for our Butter Chicken special."
*   **Schedule Posts:** (Coming Soon) "Schedule this post for tomorrow at 5 PM."

### 3. Order Management
*   **Restock:** "Create an order for 20 units of Milk."
*   **Customer Orders:** "Create a takeout order for Butter Chicken and Naan."

## 💡 Best Practices

*   **Be Specific:** Instead of "Post about food", say "Draft a Facebook post about our new spicy Biryani for the weekend."
*   **Verify:** Always double-check the AI's draft before hitting "Post" (simulated).
*   **Customer Mode:** The website has a separate "Chef AI" that helps customers find ingredients. It won't share internal info like stock counts or expiry dates.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

*   If the AI says "I don't know", try rephrasing the question.
*   If the system is slow, the local AI model might be processing a heavy request. Give it a moment.
